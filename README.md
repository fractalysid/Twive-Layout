# Lucy 32 key layout

A layout based on [pierrechevalier83](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ferris/keymaps/default) layout for ferris. It only uses 32 keys.

# Design principles

 - COLEMAK-DH
 - 32 keys, only inner thumb key used
 - 10 layouts, accessed through the home row and thumb keys
 - Modifiers on bottom row, mirrored on both sides
 - For italian language
 - SPACE and RETURN on thumb keys. BACKSPACE on right top pinky, always accessible
 - UTILITY layout, always accessible, on right thumb with TAB, ESC, DELETE, Sticky layers, caps word, GUI and so on
 - COMMON keys layout on left thumb key with keys frequently used for shell (on the right) and accents (on the left)
 - Symbols, navigation, media, numbers and functions on home row
 - KEYBOARD layout to manage keyboard functions accessible through left thumb on UTILITY layer
 - QWERTY layout accessible as a toggle layer from the KEYBOARD layout. Combo to go back to DEFAULT layer
 - No use of combos (except for the one to get away from QWERTY)
 - Heavy use of mod-tap
 
There are a lot of duplicated symbols right now so it should be easily customizable to anyone likings, especially for european languages with a lot of accented letters.

I will probably optimize the use of the RIGHT and LEFT symbols layouts but the base principles and structure should remain unchanged.

Thanks pierrechevalier83 for sharing your layout with many brilliants concepts. I would have spent months thinking to something similar.
